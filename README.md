TOP recipes project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate what I've learned in the HTML section of TOP.

I will build a basic web page using the HTML boilerplate, and will probably (not sure yet) be adding hyperlinks, images, and lists. I will also use all of the tags that have been discussed so far.

I will also be pushing edits to Github using the CLI or VSCode. I'm most uncertain about this part of it, and want to reinforce my understanding of how to stage/commit and anything else that is required. I did create and clone the repository with little help. So far, so good.
