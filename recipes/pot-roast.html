    <p><strong> Make this beautiful pot raost for a comforting weeknight dinner or special Sunday meal</strong></p>
    <p>Pot roast is delicious, even vegans cannot deny this, and only a fascist would disagree. The braising technique yields excellent results and is easy to learn and apply to other dishes where the cut of meat is not particularly tender.</p>
    <p>Pot roast is also a prime leftover to have on hand due to it's versatility as a cold, pre-cooked ingredient. It can be used to make meat pies, a delicious breakfast scramble with feta, or as part of an elevated leftovers benedict. Try it out.</p>
