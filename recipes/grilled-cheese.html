    <p><strong> Make this perfect grilled cheese for weeknight dinners, or whenever you want to eat it</strong></p>
    <p>Grilled cheese is a staple in busy households and an all-time ultimate comfort food. I ate so many damn grilled cheese sandwiches as a child, and look at me now; I'm big and strong as hell.</p>
    <p>Grilled cheese is not only tasty and satisfying, but it is easy to make. This recipe is perfect to share with young children who are interested in learning to cook, and showing your little one how to make things is a great way to bond with them while building their skills and confidence</p>
