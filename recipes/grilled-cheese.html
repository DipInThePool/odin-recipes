    <h3>Make this perfect grilled cheese for weeknight dinners, or whenever you want to eat it</h3>
    <p>Grilled cheese is a staple in busy households and an all-time ultimate comfort food. I ate so many damn grilled cheese sandwiches as a child, and look at me now; I'm big and strong as hell.</p>
    <p>Grilled cheese is not only tasty and satisfying, but it is easy to make. This recipe is perfect to share with young children who are interested in learning to cook, and showing your little one how to make things is a great way to bond with them while building their skills and confidence</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-low heat</li>
        <li>As the pan is getting up to temp., butter the outside of each slice of bread. <em>Note: you can also add some butter to the pan if you're worried about sticking, but buttering the bread instead of the pan will give you a more evenly-browned and crispy sandwich.</em></li>
        <li>Assemble the sandwich in the pan, and check for your desired level of doneness, flipping after a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Pro tip: place a lid on your pan to create a warmer environment for you perfect little 'chee to get all melty inside.</li>
    </ol>
